# Cursor Rules for Events Microservice App

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This is a microservice-based events application with:
- **API Gateway**: NestJS service handling HTTP requests and routing to microservices via Kafka
- **Event Service**: Core business logic service with MongoDB persistence
- **Kafka**: Message broker for inter-service communication
- **MongoDB**: Primary database with Mongoose ODM
- **Docker**: Containerized services with docker-compose

Remember: This is a microservice architecture - always consider the impact of changes across services and maintain proper service boundaries.
